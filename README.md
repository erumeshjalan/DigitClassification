This project demonstrates handwritten digit recognition using the Scikit-learn digits dataset. It includes:

Data loading and visualization
Image preprocessing and flattening
Training a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier
Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV
Debugging using Python's built-in pdb
Performance evaluation with classification report and confusion matrix
